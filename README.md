# HTML-CSS-CLIMB.WEBSIDE
"Hey Kuldeep here, this is my HTML and CSS project for practice. I have created a tourist website named 'Mountain Climb.' Currently, it is not responsive since it's just for practice, and I am working on other projects. However, it is fully optimized for the desktop version. Could you please have a look at my code and provide some feedback?"
